What it is
----------

bcolz provides columnar and compressed data containers.  Column storage
allows for efficiently querying tables with a large number of columns.
It also allows for cheap addition and removal of column.  In addition,
bcolz objects are compressed by default for reducing memory/disk I/O
needs.  The compression process is carried out internally by Blosc, a
high-performance compressor that is optimized for binary data.

bcolz can use numexpr internally so as to accelerate many vector and
query operations (although it can use pure NumPy for doing so too).
numexpr can use optimize the memory usage and use several cores for
doing the computations, so it is blazing fast.  Moreover, with the
introduction of a carray/ctable disk-based container (in version 0.5),
it can be used for seamlessly performing out-of-core computations.

bcolz comes with an exhaustive test suite and fully supports both
32-bit and 64-bit platforms.  Also, it is typically tested on both UNIX
and Windows operating systems.
