 Announcing carray 0.1
======================

What it is
==========

carray is a container for numerical data that can be compressed
in-memory.  The compresion process is carried out internally by Blosc,
a high-performance compressor that is optimized for binary data.

Having data compressed in-memory can reduce the stress of the memory
subsystem.  The net result is that carray operations can be faster
than using a traditional ndarray object from NumPy.

What's new
==========

Everything ;-) This is the first public release of carray, and it is
more a proof of concept to see which possibilities opens efficient
compression in in-memory data containers.

Currently carray 0.1 implements the basic container creation and
enlargeability.  Multidimensional arrays are not supported yet, and
elements cannot be modified either (i.e. no `__setitem__()` support).
