What it is
==========

carray is a container for numerical data that can be compressed
in-memory.  The compresion process is carried out internally by Blosc, a
high-performance compressor that is optimized for binary data.  Having
data compressed in-memory can reduce the stress of the memory subsystem.
The net result is that carray operations may be faster than using a
traditional ndarray object from NumPy.

carray also supports fully 64-bit addressing (both in UNIX and Windows).
