Announcing carray 0.5
=====================

What's new
----------

carray 0.5 supports completely transparent storage on-disk in addition
to memory.  That means that everything that can be done with an
in-memory container can be done using the disk instead.

The format chosen for the persistence layer is based on the 'bloscpack'
library (thanks to Valentin Haenel for his inspiration) and described in
'persistence.rst', although not everything has been implemented yet.
You may want to contribute by proposing enhancements to it.  See:
https://github.com/FrancescAlted/carray/wiki/persistence

CAVEAT: The bloscpack format is still evolving, so don't trust on
forward compatibility of the format, at least until 1.0, where the
internal format will be declared frozen.

For more detailed info, see the release notes in:
https://github.com/FrancescAlted/carray/wiki/Release-0.5


What it is
----------

carray is a chunked container for numerical data.  Chunking allows for
efficient enlarging/shrinking of data container.  In addition, it can
also be compressed for reducing memory/disk needs.  The compression
process is carried out internally by Blosc, a high-performance
compressor that is optimized for binary data.

carray comes with an exhaustive test suite and fully supports both
32-bit and 64-bit platforms.  Also, it is typically tested on both UNIX
and Windows operating systems.
