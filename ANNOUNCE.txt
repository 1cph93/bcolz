Announcing carray 0.3
=====================

What it is
==========

carray is a container for numerical data that can be compressed
in-memory.  The compresion process is carried out internally by Blosc,
a high-performance compressor that is optimized for binary data.

Having data compressed in-memory can reduce the stress of the memory
subsystem.  The net result is that carray operations can be faster
than using a traditional ndarray object from NumPy.
